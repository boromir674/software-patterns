Introduction
############

In these documentation pages we present the `software_patterns` Python package and the motivation
for publishing it. The package currently host only a handful of software patterns, but they come with
a test suite and full CI for local and remote builds.


Why would this project be useful to you?
========================================

To develop your code, while abstracting common software patterns away and focus on important business logic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- To promote the DRY prinicipal in your codebase.
- To promote the principal of Single Responsibility in your codebase.
- To promote having Simple Units of Code in your codebase.
- To keep technical debt low in your codebase.

To Learn:
---------

- You may study the source code to find out more about software design patterns.
- You may wanna learn how to make an open source code contribution and find this codebase a good place to start.


Why use this Python Patterns library?
=====================================

| It is user-friendly with a clean API designed to reduce boilerplate code needed to use a pattern in your client code.
| It comes with a 100% code coverage test suite (automated tests).
| It is statically type checked with mypy.
| It features (these) documentation pages with examples on how to use the package, doctests (see [here]) and
 complete API reference (automated) documentation.
| It is developer-friendly featuring a public CI-workflow with jobs automating running tests,
 deploying the python package to a staging server, hosting the test coverage results and visualizing the
 code dependencies and uml diagrams.
