These were the documentation pages of the `Software Patterns` project,
featuring a open source python implementation of various Software Design Patterns, automation,
public CI workflow, documentation with sphinx, doctests.

We hope this projects' features proove at least remotely
useful to another software engineer who shall get familiar
with it (the project).

Happy Libre Software!
