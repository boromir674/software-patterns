.. ===========================================

What are Software Design Patterns?

Software Engineers are employing various designs and solutions to solve their problems. The emerging code solutions targeting reoccuring problems (software patterns) have been studied and formalized in terms of how they are used, what problem they solve and why they are a fit candidate to solve it.
These code designs, which are frequently found in various code bases, are known as Software Design Patterns.
